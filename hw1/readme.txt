Time Spent: 3 hours


Notes: Dynamic Programming part was less trivial, notable roadblocks include dealing with no arguments passed (java FibonacciRace), using boolean to ensure algorithms that exceed maxTime do not run next iteration, and building methods. Relatively straightforward assignment in all.

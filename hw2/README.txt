Time Spent: 3-4 hours
Notes: Relatively straightforward, leaving the probabilistic rules to the end really helped and saved a lot of (potential) debugging time. Building the cellular array was also challenging but can be done with a simple indexing rule.
Resources: Consulted Prof. Sklar for some bugs.
